# Implementation phase handoff

## Completed phase: durable native execution core

`internal/nativeexec` now connects admitted attempt steps to the Interceptor
client and campaign journal. The [native execution guide](NATIVE_EXECUTION.md)
describes its ordering, bounds, guard checks and reporting-only reconciliation.

| Area | Implemented |
| --- | --- |
| Per-step persistence | Exact native request/response envelopes, ordered bounded journal members, separate audit reservations and verified disk reads. |
| Parent integration | Steps require an admitted/dispatched attempt; one unresolved step at a time; pending/failed/unknown steps cannot produce successful attempt completion. |
| Duplicate protection | One durable dispatch grant; native command identity preserves command/deadline while excluding worker/revision attribution. |
| Live guard | Pinned Interceptor process/session/revision and the persisted exact Docker daemon/container/image/labels/lifecycle identity. |
| Terminal handling | Failure/uncertainty fences before journal locks; the fence cancels in-flight native calls; no automatic replay or renewed deadline. |
| Reporting | One separately recorded operation-status query from reserved capacity; fingerprints/records verified; results never reopen unknown execution. |
| Restore continuity | A verified replacement can rebind future work while preserving old step results, attribution, cumulative admissions and attempt numbering. |

The executor requires trusted adapter authorization and operation-specific result
interpretation. Concrete attempt translation, selector policy, feedback filtering
and harness receipts are not implemented by these hooks. This boundary provides
the durable executor they will use; it does not expose a generic execution tool
to the harness or launch campaigns.

Tests join the real journal/attempt ledger to a scripted native peer and exercise
lost replies, completed-record reconciliation, malformed/foreign/missing records,
concurrency, live-binding failures, cancellation, verified restore adoption and the
independent Docker termination observer. A subprocess exits after native dispatch
without closing its writer; inspection retains unknown outcomes and reservations.
Storage-failure tests cover intent, dispatch, result and reconciliation writes.
These tests use synthetic operation bodies and installed test adapters; they do
not qualify operation-specific native semantics or a real Docker deployment.

Validation passed: `make test` (Go/Python and shared fixtures), `go vet ./...`,
race tests for campaign/client/Docker/executor packages, and executor test builds
for Linux amd64/arm64 and macOS amd64. Execution tests run on macOS arm64;
cross-compilation is build coverage, not runtime qualification.

## Earlier completed phase: target capability and bundle compatibility

The host `internal/capabilities` layer now verifies native capability provenance,
projects public exports, imports hash-named companions, validates bundle semantics
and checks compatibility against a ready live binding and trusted policy snapshot.
The [capability admission guide](CAPABILITY_ADMISSION.md) describes its API and
integration responsibilities.

| Area | Implemented |
| --- | --- |
| Native verification | Exact typed digest recipe, strict JSON/field shapes, supported vocabulary, duplicate identifiers and offline delivery contracts. |
| Public projection | Deterministic allowlisted records, native/public provenance hashes, full JCS projection hashing and safe companion import. |
| Bundle validation | Schema, unique IDs, internal links, coverage, narrative byte limits, artifact descriptor consistency and declared omissions. |
| Live binding | Ready process/session/revision, campaign identity, capability/environment/application hashes and advertised native profile. |
| Compatibility | Required dependencies, explicit optional gaps/disabled routes, source provenance, compatible updates and opt-in exact pins. |
| Policy handoff | Explicit host decisions and selectable action routes; preserved native profile, effective profile and allowed feedback kinds. |
| Frozen records | Unchanged bundle bytes plus authoring/live provenance, binding, policy digest and compatibility results. |

This is a host library boundary. It does not yet implement CLI export writing,
TargetProfile route resolution, per-attempt authorization or campaign startup.
Artifact descriptors do not substitute for verification and staging of actual
artifact bytes. Compatibility records must be persisted with the immutable input
and installed contract-package pins by the campaign preparation layer.

## Earlier completed phase: native Interceptor client foundation

The host-only `internal/interceptor` layer now covers the current local API routes
and their transport/lifecycle envelopes. It is ready for the next host adapter and
campaign-broker phase. It does not itself authorize guest requests or run campaigns.

| Area | Implemented |
| --- | --- |
| Connection policy | Fixed IPv4 loopback endpoint; bounded JSON; no proxy, credentials, redirects, compression, connection reuse or automatic replay. |
| Target binding | Campaign attachment, active/retained session status, instance identity checks and native closure acknowledgements. |
| Native operations | Frozen v1alpha2 envelopes, exact body digests/deadlines, dispatch and operation-record reconciliation. |
| Lifecycle | Frozen restore/stop requests, replacement lineage checks and separate lifecycle-record reconciliation. |
| Snapshots | Explicit remaining byte allowance, creation receipts, native checkpoint hashes, bounded inventory and scoped inspection. |
| Evidence transport | Configurable local ceiling, pinned native ceiling, bounded streaming, size/digest checks and private temporary-file cleanup. |
| Archive structure | Native member-name restrictions, regular-file/entry/expanded-byte limits, framing/footer checks, blob hashes and read-only member access without extraction. |

The [client guide](INTERCEPTOR_CLIENT.md) records method contracts, limits and caller
responsibilities. Existing foundations also provide shared Go/Python contract
validation, host campaign persistence/terminal fencing, transport, Docker identity
and termination, local image/release validation, configuration and input staging.

## Validation achieved

- Copied native request/capability fixtures and independently generated native
  checkpoint fixtures pin relevant serialization behavior.
- Unit tests cover malformed frames, quotas, hashes, identities, failure states,
  deadlines, temporary storage and archive boundaries.
- A stateful HTTP test covers attach/status, snapshot create/list/inspect, restore
  with a lost reply, both record ledgers, cleanup closure, confirmed stop and retained
  source-session evidence download/inspection. It verifies that effects run once
  and that reads/cleanup address the correct old or replacement session.
- The lost-reply test never resumes target experiments after uncertainty. A late
  successful record is used to locate the replacement for cleanup/reporting only.

These are protocol tests against test servers. They do not qualify a real Docker
launcher, native Linux/macOS runtime, live Interceptor target or Attack Harness.
Cross-compilation establishes build compatibility only.

Additional validation for this phase compares the Go adapter against the existing
native hash preimage and public/JCS golden files, exercises live binding failures,
required/optional dependency changes and policy denials, and checks the
profile/allowed-kind portions of every shared feedback translation vector. Safe
companion loading rejects links, special files and mismatched bytes. The new
packages pass race tests; the full Go/Python suite, fixture runners and `go vet`
pass. Capability tests also compile for Linux amd64/arm64 and macOS amd64; they
execute on macOS arm64. These builds do not qualify Docker runtime behavior.

## Next major phase: typed execution adapter and campaign preparation

The next layer must implement and integrate the following before an executable
campaign service can treat these client results as admitted work or final evidence:

1. Resolve installed TargetProfile scopes and concrete selectable routes; wire
   capability export/import and bundle checks into campaign preparation. Preserve
   the contract-package pin and recheck compatibility/readiness before launch.
2. Translate typed attempts, artifact/injection operations and feedback profiles;
   resolve handles and filter observations before exposing results to the harness.
3. Verify native evidence JSON identities, manifests, event/state hash chains,
   execution records, references, restore provenance and completeness markers.
   Structural archive inspection alone does not permit evidence publication.
4. Integrate the durable executor with the typed plan/result builder, transport
   envelope audit, cumulative non-attempt accounting and exactly-once receipt
   adoption. Arm the Docker observer and campaign/operation timers in the service;
   wire terminal target closure and cleanup to the lifecycle controller.
5. Publish verified per-session evidence into campaign retention, support later
   administrative import and cleanup of abandoned staging, and derive report inputs.

Operator campaign start/service orchestration, guest Docker launch/bootstrap and
runtime qualification follow integration of those host boundaries. The Attack
Harness dispatcher/model loop and its runtime tests remain a subsequent component
phase. No tool in the current client foundation bypasses these pending gates.
